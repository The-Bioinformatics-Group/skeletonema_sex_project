##This folder contains paired-end Skeletonema RNA-seq data

Data is paired end. Strand specific.
151 nt reads. More information can be found in fastqc report-file.

Used the software Qualimap to investigate a SAM-file where paired end reads from sample 1 had been mapped to an assembly created using both sample 1 and 2 reads.   
The results from this showed:
     mean insert size = 284.07    
     std insert size = 81.06    
     median insert size = 275    
Which should mean that the mean fragment size is: 284.07 + 302 = 586.07
