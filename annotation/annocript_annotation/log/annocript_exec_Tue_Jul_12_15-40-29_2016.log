Annocript is a tool created by the Bioinformatic Lab of SZN of Naples. 
Given a fasta file with a transcriptome, it will annotate your sequences and it will separate putative coding and long non-coding RNA sequences.

# RUNNING ANNOCRIPT CONFIGURATION #
###################################

Temporary files will be stored
Some programs will be run. In the following are listed
A PORTRAIT of your sequences will be done.
DNA2PEP on your sequences will be done.
The final table will be built
A web page and file with statistics will be created
Do you agree with it?(y or n) 
y
Ok!.. let's go!
Sequences found in your session folder. Checking it...
Annocript detected that your sequences are transcripts
Number of sequences: 39660

>>> Database settings (it will need a while):
Checking your privileges for MySQL...DB Creation not active: Database will not be downloaded and installed.
You chose to use an existent database, are you sure?(y or n):  
y
Available database versions:
2016_07 2016_06 Choose the database version: 2016_07
UniRef database is the only present. Using it...

>>> Programs settings:

>>> Setting final statistics and outputs
..OK! WELL DONE!

 WARNING: Some output files already exist! If you will run a program (BLAST, PORTRAIT, DNA2PEP) the corresponding output will be overwritten. Instead, output of BLASTx against UniRef will be different from that against TrEMBL. Continue?(y or n) 
y
Your configuration has been saved! A log file will be created in /home/mtop/Annocript_annotation/jobs/Skeletonema_sex/log/annocript_exec_Tue_Jul_12_15-40-29_2016.log. 
The overall computation usually depends from the number of sequences and the speed of the machine you are using. 
You may want to check Annocript step-by-step with the following command: more /home/mtop/Annocript_annotation/jobs/Skeletonema_sex/log/annocript_exec_Tue_Jul_12_15-40-29_2016.log.

You will find all the results in the folder you chose here. Please take a look at
 https://github.com/frankMusacchia/Annocript/blob/master/GUIDE/OUTPUT.md to understand the output from Annocript and the organization of folders.

Please let us know if any problem occurs during the computation or you don't get from Annocript the expected result.
