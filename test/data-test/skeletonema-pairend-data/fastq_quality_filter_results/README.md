##This folder contains the results of quality-filtering the pairedend-data

###Sorted out orphans
The filtering and trimming process resulted in orphaned reads in the read files due to one read of a pair being of poor quality and being completely removed whereas the other remained.  
Some subsequent analysis' required that the pairs are intact, and for this reason a script was utilized to seperate the orphans from the complete pairs.
