##This is the folder of the paired-end RNA-seq skeletonema data

After filtering low quality reads and removing adapters, this data will be used together with the single-end RNA-seq data to create a reference transcriptome assembly against which the single-end RNA seq reads from the RNA-sex sequencing will be mapped and expression evaluated.
