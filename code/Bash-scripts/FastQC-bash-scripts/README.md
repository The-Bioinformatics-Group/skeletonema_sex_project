##This folder contains bash-scripts for running FastQC and other read-filtering/analysis software

All of the scripts in this folder does the same thing. They are quite redundant, they could as well be one file but I don't dare to remove anything yet and they don't take up much room. 

###fastqc_run.sh

The purpose of this script is to run fastqc of a specific file.

###fastqc_run_many.sh

This script runs fastqc on all files in a specific folder. Specifically in this case, the single end trimmed and filtered files.
